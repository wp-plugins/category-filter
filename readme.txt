Filter a large number of categories when editing posts.

== Description ==

If your site has a large number of categories, it can be helpful to be able to search through them rather than scrolling to find the one you need. This plugin adds a text box to the category list which filters the list in place, rather than providing an AJAX autocorrect, so it's very fast. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `categoryfilter.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. Category Filter in the Edit Post section.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First release.
